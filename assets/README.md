From [a slideshow repo](https://github.com/leemark/better-simple-slideshow):
* js/better-simple-slideshow.js
* css/simple-slideshow-styles.css

The slideshow code licensed under the Mozilla license, which specifies that 
the code may be freely distributed and modified as desired, as long as the code
isn't used in a patented code.  Because this is a web page with open code, 
a patent license is unnecessary.  In this case the javascript is an unaltered
copy while the stylesheet has been fudged a little to have a larger caption font 
on a darker background.
